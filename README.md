A python script to get the newest hip-hop songs on https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/songs/ and add them to a Spotify playlist

First you will need a client id, client secret and your Spotify username. Register your app in https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications to get your client id and secret.

Run the file by typing python script.py [username] [client_id] [client_secret]

The first time the script is being run, you will be redirected to a site asking for authorization to access and modify your Spotify data (creating the playlist). Then you will be prompted for the URL the program redirected you to.
